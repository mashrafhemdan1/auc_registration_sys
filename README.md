# AUC Registration System
This project is done as part of the Fundamentals of Database systems course at the American University in Cairo. 
The project is a small university registration system with a front-end to get user inputs and print outputs and a back-end that communicates with the database. They are implemented in Python using Flask library. The associated files are included in the app folder. 
The database contains the courses, sections, students, cross_listed courses, prerequisites, and grades. This database is implemented as a relational database using MySQL DBMS. The Build queries, along with the dump files, are included in the database folder. 
The AUC catalog is used to fill the database. The courses were crawled from the AUC catalog using Scrappy library in Python. The files are included in the crawler folder.
The database is hosted online in a MySQL online host service, remotemysql.com. The credentials are included in the Python files.
